# To-Do List App

This is my first React (Next) app, a simple To-Do List application where you can add tasks and edit them later.

## Features

- Add new tasks to your to-do list.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete.
- Delete tasks.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

### Running the App
